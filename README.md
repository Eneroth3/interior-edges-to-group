# Group Interior Edges

Group the edges between coplanar faces and merge the faces.

Useful if you want to keep an an edge pattern for later use but don't want it to
split up the faces. I use it to manage engraving patterns separately from the
actual cuts in a laser cutting workflow.

To reverse, simply explode the group.
